# 🏗️ Architecture Overview — General Vue 3 App Template

This document outlines the recommended architecture and folder structure for a modular, maintainable Vue 3 application that separates concerns clearly and supports scalability.

## 📁 Folder & File Structure

/src  
├── assets/              # Static assets like images, fonts, styles  
├── components/          # Reusable base UI components (buttons, dialogs, etc.)  
├── composables/         # Reusable Composition API functions (logic hooks)  
├── layouts/             # Layout components (page wrappers, headers, footers)  
├── pages/               # Vue views mapped to routes  
├── router/              # Vue Router setup and route definitions  
├── store/               # Pinia stores for state management  
├── services/            # API clients, data-fetching logic, utilities  
├── styles/              # Global styles, variables, mixins (e.g. SCSS)  
├── tests/               # Unit and integration tests  
├── App.vue              # Root app component  
└── main.js / main.ts    # App entry point, createApp setup

## 🧱 Core Architecture Principles

- **Modularity:**  
  Separate UI components, business logic (composables), state, and data services into distinct folders to encourage reuse and testability.

- **Single Responsibility:**  
  Each component or composable focuses on one concern.

- **State Management:**  
  Use Pinia stores with clear domain boundaries. Avoid mixing UI state and data state.

- **Routing:**  
  Define routes in a dedicated router folder. Use lazy loading for pages to optimize performance.

- **Styling:**  
  Use global styles and design tokens (variables) in a centralized styles folder. Components have scoped styles.

- **Testing:**  
  Co-locate tests with components or place them in a separate tests folder. Use Vitest or preferred test runner.

## ⚙️ Development Workflow

1. **Component-First**  
   Develop isolated base components with Storybook for visual testing and documentation.

2. **Composable Logic**  
   Extract reusable logic into composables to keep components thin and declarative.

3. **API Integration**  
   Use services to abstract API calls and handle data transformations. Services return plain data.

4. **State Sync**  
   Use Pinia stores to share state across components and pages. Keep stores focused and small.

## 🔧 Scalability & Maintenance

- Organize by feature or domain for large projects (e.g. `/features/tree/` containing components, store, composables related to that feature).  
- Keep global/shared components and utilities separate from feature-specific code.  
- Maintain strict naming conventions for clarity.  
- Document folder purpose and conventions for new team members.

## 🧩 Example Feature Folder (Optional)

/src/features/  
└── example-feature/  
    ├── components/  
    ├── composables/  
    ├── store.js  
    ├── api.js  
    └── index.js

This architecture is designed to work with modern Vue 3 apps but can be adapted for other frameworks by adjusting conventions.
