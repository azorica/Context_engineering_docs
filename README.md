## 🗂️ Folder Overview (Context Engineering)

This project is structured for use with AI tools (like Cursor or Claude) using context-based prompt engineering. Main folders include:

- `context-rules/` – product goals, constraints, examples
- `prompts/` – reusable templates for generating features, tests, etc.
- `templates/` – UI or code scaffolds
- `.cursor/` – optional context config (Cursor-specific)

## 📌 Next Steps

[What comes next? Are you defining features? Building core layout? Listing user stories?]

---

## 🚀 Goals for the AI Agent

- Build features using a consistent component style
- Follow app architecture and naming conventions
- Avoid known anti-patterns or deprecated methods
